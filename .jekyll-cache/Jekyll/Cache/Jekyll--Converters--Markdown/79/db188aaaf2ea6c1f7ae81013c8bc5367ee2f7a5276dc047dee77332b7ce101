<p>Low temperature fuel kinetics is critical to sustainable automotive propulsion systems development. However, existing models do not reliably reproduce realworld outcomes partially due to the limited experimental results.</p>

<p>This sensor is specifically designed to probe specific pyrolysis products that may form during low-temperature fuel pyrolysis. The sensor is based on supercontinuum light source, a broadband laser source capable of ouputing across the entire visible and the near-IR spectrum. This source was mated with a fast spectru-resolving diagnostic technique tor probe absorption spectra of key species present during fuel pyrolysis. The sensor is currently under active development and characterization.</p>
