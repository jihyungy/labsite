In-line optical thermometry using OFDR

#### Description

This study is focused on developing optical sensing technique for probing temperature and strain along an optical fiber. It is expected to probe small temperature variations with high spatial resolution, ideal for characterizing temperature distribution within dense energy storage systems and compact energy conversion systems with no electromagnetic interferences.

The sensor is based on an optical diagnostic technique known as Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). The sensing element is miniscule (hundreds of microns), flexible, and affordable. It can withstand vibrations and severe temperatures (up to 600C).
